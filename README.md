# EarlyPaleogeneClimate
# This is a web map version of climate maps for the Early Paleogene (65-47.8 Ma) based on compiled data from peer review articles and created for A Glimpse of an Extremely Warm World - Lessons from the Early Paleogene (Slawson et al., 2025).
# The default is for the modern map to be turned on. To view a single time period, turn off all layers except for time period proxy locations, climate type, and base map.
